      <h1>Running a game day for GOV.UK</h1>
      <h2 class="date">February 6 2015</h2>

      <p><em>This is a blog post I wrote for the GDS Technology blog. You can read
the original
<a href="https://gdstechnology.blog.gov.uk/2015/02/06/running-a-game-day-for-gov-uk/">here</a>.</em></p>
<p>For much of January, GOV.UK had a firebreak. It’s where teams are
given some time to investigate new ideas and clean up technical
debt. As part of this we ran a game day. In this blog post I’m going
to explain what game days are, what we did and what we learnt.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-game-day">What is a game day?</h3>
<p>The reality is that we can’t prevent the unexpected. However, there
are some ways that we can prepare ourselves for it. We shouldn’t treat
these unexpected events as outside the bounds of what we’re able to
test. Instead, we should try to use them as a way to provide more
feedback and help us become more resilient. The advantage of this is
that it doesn’t rely on a big disaster to occur before we can learn
how to improve our systems. The added benefit is that the scope can be
defined by the team. This is where game days come in.</p>
<p>Game days are designed to let learning happen in a safe, controlled
fashion. They’re exercises designed to teach teams how to adapt to the
inevitable: system failure at all
levels. <a href="http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2371297">Literature</a>
suggests that, in technical operations, they were created by Amazon in
the early 2000s. They took the model of firefighter training — where
major failures were injected into critical systems on purpose — and
applied it to technology systems, software and the people surrounding
them.</p>
<p>Things break, disasters happen and system failure is inevitable. The
main thing about preparing for it is first to accept it. And we knew
just where to start: the 2nd line team.</p>
<h3 id="2nd-line-team">2nd line team</h3>
<p>For those new to the term, the 2nd line team are the technical support
team for GOV.UK. They’re the technical counterpart to the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqaAvbHY3ug">GOV.UK helpdesk</a>, the
1st line team. They look at our
<a href="https://www.icinga.org/">monitoring systems</a> and
<a href="http://graphite.wikidot.com/">related metrics</a> to make sure GOV.UK is
working as expected, as well as doing some day-to-day gardening to
make sure GOV.UK continues to operate in a healthy state.</p>
<p>The 2nd line team consists of three people, usually a
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/the-team/web-operations">web operations engineer</a>
and two software developers. They’re rotated on and off the 2nd line
team on a weekly basis from the different product teams that work on
GOV.UK. We’ve run a 2nd line team in some form since the launch of
GOV.UK in October 2012.</p>
<p>For our first game day we were really interested to see how this team
would cope with a number of disaster scenarios. This is because we’d
expect them to be the first people looking into what was going on. All
of the scenarios we ran were on our staging environment which is a
one-to-one replica of our production environment (including traffic)
so that we wouldn’t affect users of GOV.UK.</p>
<h3 id="structure-of-the-game-day">Structure of the game day</h3>
<p>A number of us got together to discuss what we wanted to learn for our
first game day. The common themes were about how prepared we were and
how we could improve our systems.</p>
<p>Following on from this, four of us agreed to become the organisers for
the first game day. We would be open to suggestions throughout the
design process but would keep the details under wraps. We didn’t want
to risk priming the 2nd line team. We used a number of brilliant
resources that are available to help us design the game day. These
range from a
<a href="http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2371516">high-level overview</a>
through to a more
<a href="https://stripe.com/blog/game-day-exercises-at-stripe">hands on report</a>.</p>
<p>One of our goals was to make sure the individuals on 2nd line didn’t
feel they were the ones at fault. We wanted to make it very clear to
them that being unable to find a fix for, or way around, the disaster
wasn’t viewed as a failing on them as individuals or as a team. And
should they need our help we’d more than happily jump in to “undo”
what damage we’d caused. It was about learning where the gaps are in
our systems to learn how to make them more resilient.</p>
<p>In the end we decided on two major scenarios: emergency publishing and
complete data loss.</p>
<h3 id="emergency-publishing">Emergency publishing</h3>
<p>In the event of a national emergency it’s quite likely that the
government will have an official response. They would publish a page
of up-to-date information for members of the public. If this occurs,
we show a clear banner on all relevant pages, linking through to a
summary page with more relevant information.</p>
<p><img src="https://gdstechnology.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2015/02/test-national-emergency1-1024x699.png" alt="Screenshot of what a test national emergency message on GOV.UK looks like"></p>
<p>We’ve run this scenario through a number of times, and automated a lot
of it. For the game day we wanted to test how the 2nd line team would
cope when the method of deployment and access to the environment where
GOV.UK is hosted were both removed. They were asked at the start of
the scenario to deploy the national emergency message. However, before
they began we removed their access to the VPN and infrastructure that
stores our documentation for such an event. The documentation itself
uses <a href="http://sphinx-doc.org/">static files</a> and can be checked out as
a local repository. As part of our 2nd line process members of the
team are asked to keep an up-to-date local copy.</p>
<p>Some of the parts of the scenario are in our documentation, but we as
the organisers weren’t sure whether the 2nd line team were aware of
what to do in this situation. In the end, the 2nd line team found an
alternate way into the environment which they all have relevant
credentials for, deployed the national emergency message and completed
the first game day scenario faster than we were expecting.</p>
<h3 id="complete-data-loss">Complete data loss</h3>
<p>For the second scenario of the day we asked the 2nd line team to go
about their usual duties: to watch the monitoring tools and to pick
stories from the 2nd line team’s backlog.</p>
<p>As this was going on, we began to remove entire databases from
GOV.UK. We ran the equivalent of <code>DROP database;</code> for each of the
database products we use and watched the aftermath. To make things
particularly difficult we also removed local backups that existed on
the database machines and separate backup machines that exist in the
virtual data center. This would force the team to use offsite backups,
which would be an unknown method for many of them as well as
significantly slower.</p>
<p>This is a terrible situation to experience for anyone, but we learnt a
lot about gaps in our monitoring and documentation. There were a
number of warnings across our infrastructure before critical alerts
started to appear. It took the team a few minutes to realise what was
happening, and to finally understand the repercussions.</p>
<p>Once the team realised what had happened, they quickly decided they
needed to restore database backups and work out what else was going
on. The team split into two groups: one set looking to restore
database backups and the other investigating what was going on. They
quickly saw that a member of the GOV.UK team (a game day organiser)
had gone rogue and started causing damage. The 2nd line team removed
credentials for the offending user and blocked their access.</p>
<p>When trying to restore database backups the team were having trouble
following the documentation. The documentation for offsite backups was
out of date because we had recently switched to a
<a href="http://duplicity.nongnu.org/">new offsite backup process</a>. One member
of the 2nd line team had worked on this recently, so they knew where
to look and what to do. Had they not been on the team this could have
been difficult to understand and they wouldn’t immediately know that
they would need to speak to other members of the GOV.UK team.</p>
<p>As the 2nd line team started to restore database backups one by one
they saw some oddness. One big thing we learnt from this process is
that our offsite backups for PostgreSQL were truncated. They were
backups from the PostgreSQL secondaries and had data missing. Overall
the scenario was completed and database backups had been restored
within a matter of hours.</p>
<h3 id="what-next">What next?</h3>
<p>After running game days for GOV.UK, we’ve realised what a rich source
of feedback and insight we’ve been missing out on. They’ve shown that
being able to simulate failure in a safe environment, where some of
the stresses and pressures are removed is an incredible way to learn
more about your systems.</p>
<p>The reality is that you get good at what you practice. If you can
practice your responses to bad things happening, your reactions will
hopefully be better when a real problem arises. With this knowledge,
we’re going to run more game days and run them more often. Both across
GOV.UK and within product teams.</p>
