      <h1>Deployment Contracts</h1>
      <h2 class="date">November 10 2015</h2>

      <p>I’ve been in a number of discussions recently around how to improve
deployment workflows and how best to implement (and improve upon)
<a href="http://12factor.net/">12-Factor applications</a> in a continuous
delivery environment. The following is a bunch of assumptions,
desires, and implementations I have. It’s entirely aimed at what some
organisations are calling their “platform team” and might not be
applicable to all use-cases.</p>
<h2 id="helping-everyone-do-more">Helping everyone do more</h2>
<p>For the majority of modern day platform teams their task is to
understand the needs of the teams they support and to provide simpler
processes for them to do what they need to do. Specifically:</p>
<ol>
<li>How can we help our colleagues go from nothing to something as quick as possible?</li>
<li>How can we help our colleagues improve upon widely used services over time?</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="implicit-vs-explicit">Implicit vs. Explicit</h2>
<p>Many teams have to deal with a myriad of different requirements. Some
even have fixed deadlines thrown in for extra measure. In those
situations smart teams tend to start from a consistent mindset: they
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/design-principles#second">do less</a>.</p>
<p>Even smarter teams standardise workflows to help the masses that
depend on them go faster. Standardisation can take two routes:
documentation and enforcement. Things you <strong>should</strong> do and things
that you <strong>must</strong> do. Or, to put it another way, implicit
vs. explicit.</p>
<p>In the rest of this post I’d like to discuss how you can make such
tooling explicit to teams to help them go faster.</p>
<h2 id="brakes-help-you-go-faster">Brakes help you go faster</h2>
<p>Product teams want to create and update applications, whenever they
want, at speed.</p>
<p>To help them do this, you might build some tools to simplify the
process. Along the way, you might also build some brakes in to help
them go faster around the obstacles they’re likely to hit as they aim
to get closer to production.</p>
<p>These tools might be libraries or services, but you’ll need a
consistent artefact to ease communication. Let’s look at a small
example of a UI and a machine-readable (JSON) file.</p>
<h2 id="starting-a-new-application">Starting a new application</h2>
<p>For any application to be worked on, it needs a name and a place to
live. Let’s assume this interaction starts with a user interface:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/images/service-create.jpg"
         alt="Example deployment form"/> 
</figure>

<p>When teams (or a product owner) submit a name for their new service a
number of things happen automatically:</p>
<ol>
<li>a version control repository is created with the provided name</li>
<li>a continuous integration job (for master and for any branches)</li>
<li>a basic development environment for the application</li>
<li>a status page showing the development state of the application (Is
it running? How long ago it was both created and last modified?
Who has worked on it?)</li>
</ol>
<p>This means that a team can start prototyping and testing out ideas
without having to worry about going beyond a basic development
environment.</p>
<p>You might also abstract away a number of application decisions so that
teams can concentrate on building their products. By providing
libraries upfront, you can get get rid of a number of decisions for a
team. Libraries that provide:</p>
<ol>
<li>a standardised way to do logging</li>
<li>common endpoints for monitoring and healthchecks for web
frameworks</li>
<li>storage for short lived session data</li>
<li>user authentication</li>
</ol>
<p>Once a prototype has been built and briefly tested with users you
might want to move it into increasingly more “real” test environments.</p>
<h2 id="a-machine-readable-contract">A machine-readable contract</h2>
<p>It’s rare that applications run by themselves. In many cases they are
one small part of a bigger system. However making sure all of these
applications play nicely in a distributed system is no small feat.</p>
<p>To have an application be deployable in a number of different testing
environments means providing some useful information for operators. In
the following sections I’m going to describe a JSON file that might
help ease moving a prototype into production.</p>
<p>Earlier in this post I showed a small sketch of a user interface. I
described how it did a number of things automatically for a team. A
fuller example could create a structured text file describing the
application, a deployment contract. So what would this file look like?</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-json" data-lang="json">{
  <span style="color:#000080">&#34;language&#34;</span>: <span style="color:#d14">&#34;clojure&#34;</span>,
  <span style="color:#000080">&#34;script&#34;</span>: [<span style="color:#d14">&#34;lein test&#34;</span>],
  <span style="color:#000080">&#34;dependencies&#34;</span>: [
    {<span style="color:#000080">&#34;service&#34;</span>: <span style="color:#d14">&#34;postgresql&#34;</span>},
    {<span style="color:#000080">&#34;service&#34;</span>: <span style="color:#d14">&#34;authentication&#34;</span>}
  ],
  <span style="color:#000080">&#34;healthcheck&#34;</span>: <span style="color:#d14">&#34;/healthcheck&#34;</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>This JSON file would provide the deployment contract that an
application makes with the environment that it’s going to run
in. Moving up through various environments and into production would
require more detail to be added to this file and for each environment
to assert what’s required (exposed by the status page) before the team
can continue.</p>
<p>To get into a similar pre-production environment the application’s
manifest might have to provide a list of monitoring endpoints. This is
useful because rather than monitoring endpoints existing in config
management code it can registered (and updated) upon deploying a
service into an environment.</p>
<p>The updated manifest file would look like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-json" data-lang="json">{
  <span style="color:#000080">&#34;language&#34;</span>: <span style="color:#d14">&#34;clojure&#34;</span>,
  <span style="color:#000080">&#34;script&#34;</span>: [<span style="color:#d14">&#34;lein test&#34;</span>],
  <span style="color:#000080">&#34;dependencies&#34;</span>: [
    {<span style="color:#000080">&#34;service&#34;</span>: <span style="color:#d14">&#34;postgresql&#34;</span>},
    {<span style="color:#000080">&#34;service&#34;</span>: <span style="color:#d14">&#34;authentication&#34;</span>}
  ],
  <span style="color:#000080">&#34;healthcheck&#34;</span>: <span style="color:#d14">&#34;/healthcheck&#34;</span>,
  <span style="color:#000080">&#34;monitoring&#34;</span>: [
    {
      <span style="color:#000080">&#34;endpoint&#34;</span>: <span style="color:#d14">&#34;/user/*&#34;</span>,
      <span style="color:#000080">&#34;percentiles&#34;</span>: {
        <span style="color:#000080">&#34;90th&#34;</span>: <span style="color:#d14">&#34;X&#34;</span>,
        <span style="color:#000080">&#34;95th&#34;</span>: <span style="color:#d14">&#34;Y&#34;</span>,
        <span style="color:#000080">&#34;99th&#34;</span>: <span style="color:#d14">&#34;Z&#34;</span>
      }
    }
  ]
}
</code></pre></div><h2 id="getting-to-production">Getting to production</h2>
<p>In terms of infrastructure environments, the final step associated
with getting to production for some teams requires a security
audit. The automatic registration of the manifest in an environment
could manage this process when it’s triggered in one of the final
pre-production environments.</p>
<p>The other step required to get into product is having a list of
members of the team that are on-call for the application. The updated
manifest would look like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-json" data-lang="json">{
  <span style="color:#000080">&#34;language&#34;</span>: <span style="color:#d14">&#34;clojure&#34;</span>,
  <span style="color:#000080">&#34;script&#34;</span>: [<span style="color:#d14">&#34;lein test&#34;</span>],
  <span style="color:#000080">&#34;dependencies&#34;</span>: [
    {<span style="color:#000080">&#34;service&#34;</span>: <span style="color:#d14">&#34;postgresql&#34;</span>},
    {<span style="color:#000080">&#34;service&#34;</span>: <span style="color:#d14">&#34;authentication&#34;</span>}
  ],
  <span style="color:#000080">&#34;healthcheck&#34;</span>: <span style="color:#d14">&#34;/healthcheck&#34;</span>,
  <span style="color:#000080">&#34;monitoring&#34;</span>: [
    {
      <span style="color:#000080">&#34;endpoint&#34;</span>: <span style="color:#d14">&#34;/user/*&#34;</span>,
      <span style="color:#000080">&#34;percentiles&#34;</span>: {
        <span style="color:#000080">&#34;90th&#34;</span>: <span style="color:#d14">&#34;X&#34;</span>,
        <span style="color:#000080">&#34;95th&#34;</span>: <span style="color:#d14">&#34;Y&#34;</span>,
        <span style="color:#000080">&#34;99th&#34;</span>: <span style="color:#d14">&#34;Z&#34;</span>
      }
    }
  ],
  <span style="color:#000080">&#34;team&#34;</span>: {
    <span style="color:#000080">&#34;oncall&#34;</span>: [
      {
        <span style="color:#000080">&#34;name&#34;</span>: <span style="color:#d14">&#34;Kushal Pisavadia&#34;</span>,
        <span style="color:#000080">&#34;tel&#34;</span>: <span style="color:#d14">&#34;+447700000000&#34;</span>
      }
    ]
  }
}
</code></pre></div><p>With this in place a product team can happily choose to make a release
of their application and put it into the production environment when
they’re ready. A side benefit to operators is they now have a number
of services that all describe how to test them, how to monitor them,
how to escalate and what services depend on each other. That’s
incredibly powerful.</p>
<h2 id="in-conclusion">In conclusion</h2>
<p>Hopefully this description of a hand-held process from nothing to
production is useful. It’s a small introduction to how platform teams
might provide tools to help their teams move faster.</p>
<p>If you take anything away from this post it’s that we should start to
think long term about the kinds of things that we as operators care
about. Not containers or whatever new technology exists over the
horizon, but how we help our colleagues deliver. Then when a new
technology does arrive our only role will be to integrate it against
our existing deployment contracts. In addition, by using such tools
you can provide useful information to your infrastructure (about your
services) to help you make better decisions along the way.</p>
<p>It’s worth saying that this shouldn’t be seen as a one size fits all
solution. There are going to be many problems along the way and your
job (as a platform/operations team) is to enable the teams that depend
on you as much as possible. Sticking to a fixed script isn’t always
the best move.</p>
