      <h1>Removable storage is just for the spec sheets</h1>
      <h2 class="date">January 12 2010</h2>

      <p>Google released their <em>official phone</em> early last week: the
<a href="http://www.google.com/phone">Nexus One</a>. Putting aside the fact that
they’ve completely
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/01/08/google_nexus_partner_friendly/">shafted</a>
all of their technology partners, I’d like to discuss how spec sheets
are ruining the user experience of mobile devices. Many users (myself
included) may plead the case for expandable storarge, but there is
strong resistance when users are forced to manage their own files. Bad
UI of file browsers and locks preventing data from being moved make
using removable storage on phones a drain.</p>

<p>A prime example of this is my current phone —
<a href="http://www.nokia.co.uk/find-products/all-phones/nokia-n73">Nokia N73</a>
— which comes with 32MB of built-in storage but is expandable using
the provided miniSD slot. I thought this would be brilliant! I could
store applications, images, messages and contacts all on the miniSD
card and never have to worry about transferring any of this data,
phone to phone, ever again. As always, there’s a catch. I’m limited to
storing just media files on the miniSD card and all other data is
stored on the phone’s paltry memory. The reasoning provided is for
security, but surely I — as the user — should be able to choose where
my own personal files are stored?</p>

<p>In much a similar way, Google is failing to understand the same issues
that are plaguing my three year old phone. While the Nexus One has an
expandable Micro SD card, the on-board memory is just 512MB. This
wouldn’t be too bad until you take into account that the Nexus One is
a smart phone targeted towards users who will take advantage of its
many applications. Sadly, a limit has been placed on how much storage
can be used for applications to 190mb:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Nexus can accommodate memory cards up to 32 gigabytes (a 4
gigabyte card comes with it) — and yet, inexplicably, the Nexus
allots only the tiniest sliver of that (190 megabytes) for
downloaded
apps. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/06/technology/personaltech/06pogue.html?hp">Source</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why are Google so insistent on messing up the storage situation on
Android phones? The N1 had 512mB memory built-in, which Android will
only use for storing the OS, applications and any relevant application
data. Similarly, the earlier G1 went through the same issues having
just 256MB built-in memory, which wasn’t even enough to install any
official OS updates! Instead of learning their lesson, Google has just
taken it up one notch. Rather than learn from these mistakes and
become a real competitor to Apple, they’ve failed miserably.</p>

<p>Considering the cost of physical memory these days, it doesn’t make
sense when companies aren’t willing to increase built-in storage
sizes. These days 4GB storage should be seen as a minimum, while
allowing room for premium <abbr title="Stock-Keeping Unit">SKUs</abbr>
with 32GB+ to pile on markup without anyone complaining. Apple’s
abhorrence towards removable storage isn’t just because Jobs’ saying
is final, or compromise on form factor, but simply because it’s a
usability nightmare.</p>

<p>Modded firmware has been released for most phones, allowing users to
bend the will of their mobile device’s storage. However, allowing all
photos, music and applications on the removable media will mean that
it has to be unmounted on the device, removing the use of any
applications in the process. I understand that an easy way around this
may be to expose a samba share, e.g. Archos, rather than give direct
access to the storage media, but what’s to prevent a user from just
ejecting the media and doing so anyway?</p>

<p>As a result of this fatal flaw, I have no plans on buying the new
Nexus One in the immediate future. If I were to purchase a new phone
based purely on usability of storage, it would probably be an
iPhone. Alternatively, I could just stick with my current N73 and save
myself a lot of <em>wasted</em> money on applications.</p>
