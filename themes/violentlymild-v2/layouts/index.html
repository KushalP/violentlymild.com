      <h1>Violently Mild</h1>

      <p><strong>I&#8217;m Kushal Pisavadia, a senior technology
          leader who enjoys building out digital products and
          operating them.</strong></p>

      <p>I&#8217;m currently a software engineer
        at <a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple</a>, and
        I&#8217;m always looking to meet interesting people who are
        excited about building things or tackling big challenges.</p>

      <p>Previously I was a Senior SRE at <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/">Bloomberg</a>, the Platform Lead team for <a href="https://11fs.com/">a startup</a> building a banking
        platform, the CTO of a five&#8208;person startup, a Lead Systems Engineer at <a href="https://www.klarna.com/">Klarna</a>, a
        Senior Software Engineer at <a href="https://gocardless.com/">GoCardless</a>, and a
        Senior Software Engineer at the <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/">Government Digital Service</a>, on things
        like <a href="https://www.gov.uk/">GOV.UK</a>.</p>

      <p>I (sometimes) post on <a href="https://www.violentlymild.com/posts/">my blog</a>, relay brief updates in short-form
        to <a href="http://twitter.com/KushalP">Twitter</a> and post my code to <a href="http://github.com/KushalP">Github</a>. The
        easiest way to get hold of me is by <a href="mailto:kushal@violentlymild.com">email</a>.</p>
