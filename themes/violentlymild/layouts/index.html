      <h1>Violently Mild</h1>

      <p><strong>I&#8217;m Kushal Pisavadia, a senior technology
          leader who enjoys building out digital products and
          operating them.</strong></p>

      <p>I&#8217;m currently on the hunt for my next big challenge;
      either a new thing with people looking to begin an
      adventure, or an early-stage startup requiring senior
      technical leadership to take them to the next level.</p>

      <p>Previously I was the CTO of a five person startup, a Lead
      Systems Engineer
      at <a href="https://www.klarna.com/">Klarna</a>, a Senior
      Software Engineer
      at <a href="https://gocardless.com/">GoCardless</a>, and a
      Senior Software Engineer at
      the <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/">Government Digital
      Service</a>, on things
        like <a href="https://www.gov.uk/">GOV.UK</a>.</p>

      <p>I (sometimes) post on <a href="{{ .Site.BaseURL }}posts/">my
      blog</a>, relay brief updates in short-form
      to <a href="http://twitter.com/KushalP">Twitter</a> and post my
      code to <a href="http://github.com/KushalP">Github</a>. The
      easiest way to get hold of me is
        by <a href="mailto:kushal@violentlymild.com">email</a>.</p>
