      <h1>Just a few more tweaks</h1>
      <h2 class="date">February 12 2010</h2>

      

<p>Whether you’re a designer or developer, tweaks can become the bane of
your existence or the fastest way to ship that feature. When you’re
working to a deadline or budget it’s not always possible to be as
thorough as you’d like, so when should you be doing those tweaks?</p>

<h3 id="solving-usability-problems">Solving usability problems</h3>

<p>In a previous post I explained
<a href="/posts/why-you-should-do-usability-testing/">why you should do usability testing</a>. Something
that I neglected to explain is that doing usability testing shouldn’t
trigger mass rewrites of code or entire redesigns of
functionality. Once you’ve got your results and have them prioritised
you should: fix the biggest problems, with the least effort, that can
be solved for most people. After these issues have been fixed, try
testing the system once more and you’ll be able to gain better
feedback on what you might be missing.</p>

<h3 id="tweak-or-redesign">Tweak or Redesign</h3>

<p>The most obvious benefits of tweaking include: reduced cost, less work
and faster completion time. However, from a project management
perspective, tweaks are much more likely to happen as they don’t
require as much planning, client meetings or questioning to get signed
off compared to big overhauls. In addition to this, most people aren’t
too fond of entire redesigns, so a tweak might mean less of the user’s
time needs to be spent on understanding what’s changed.</p>

<p>On the other hand, too many tweaks can make for a confusing system. By
adding too many tweaks at the same time you may sacrifice the
navigation or continuity of the system, leading to long-term
issues. Sometimes a well thought out implementation can produce better
results than a bundle of tweaks that are poorly executed.</p>

<h3 id="tweak-and-then-refactor">Tweak and then refactor</h3>

<p>You’re never going to end up with perfect solution on the first try
(maybe you do, I don’t know), but it’s always best to iterate and then
clean up. Personally, after every five tweaks that I implement I tend
to try and clean them up where possible. My thinking behind this is
that five tweaks aren’t so many to cause issues down the line, but any
more may give you problems when adding functionality at a later date.</p>

<p>In conclusion, while tweaks tend to be frowned upon they are a
necessary evil. As long as you clean up what you’ve done on a regular
basis, you won’t cause yourself too many major issues.</p>
